# Software Containers

Prior to World War II, most international shipments were strapped to pallets or loaded in crates or bags. Cargo would be delivered to a warehouse by the dock and each piece would be individually loaded onto the ship. After the ship had reached its destination, each piece would be individually unloaded into another warehouse.

The break bulk system worked for most of the history of shipping, but it was far from perfect. Loading and unloading ships was a time-consuming process that required lots of equipment and involved hundreds of people. Cargo was often damaged and occasionally stolen, and ships had to be thoroughly cleaned between loads.

[Intermodal containers][intermodal-containers] solved most of those problems (and, in turn, revolutionized the shipping industry) by antiquating the idea of individual pieces of cargo. The steel containers eliminated the need for warehouses and large dock crews and made the process of shipping significantly easier.

## Virtualization

In the context of computing, we say that virtualization is the abstraction of underlying physical resources. Containers simplify shipping in the same way that virtualization simplifies software. For example, a crane can unload a container without worrying about what’s inside it in the same way that a program can write to a disk without worrying about any of the details (whether it’s a physical drive or a network share, how it’s connected, how it’s formatted, etc.).
