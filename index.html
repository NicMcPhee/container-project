                                <h1 id="software-containers">Software Containers</h1>
<p>Prior to World War II, most international shipments were strapped to pallets or loaded in crates or bags. Cargo would be delivered to a warehouse near the dock and each piece would be individually loaded onto the ship. After the ship had reached its destination, each piece would be individually unloaded into another warehouse.</p>
<p>The break bulk system worked for most of the history of shipping, but it was far from optimal. Loading and unloading ships was a time-consuming process that required specialized equipment and involved hundreds of people. Cargo was often damaged and occasionally stolen, and ships had to be thoroughly cleaned between loads.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container" target="_blank">Shipping containers</a> addressed those problems (and, in turn, revolutionized the shipping industry) by antiquating the idea of individual pieces of cargo. Strong, standardized containers eliminated the need for warehouses and large dock crews and introduced enormous improvements in efficiency, simplicity, and safety.</p>
<p>Software containers do for application deployment what shipping containers do for freight. Instead of relying on complicated scripts to prepare the deployment environment, software developers can pack configuration and dependencies into a container and be assured that the application will run correctly.</p>
<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<p>To understand the benefits of containers, it helps to know a little bit about virtualization. Virtualization, as the name implies, refers to the use of virtual resources (memory, disk, etc.). Any reasonably designed system depends on virtualization. For instance, when a text editor writes to a file, it should be able to do so without any knowledge of the underlying storage device. Similarly, a web browser should be able to request a page without worrying about the underlying network interfaces or low-level protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware virtualization</strong> virtualizes a complete machine, allowing a complete operating system to run as a guest on top of the host operating system. Virtual machines offer several advantages over physical machines: they can be created from predefined images, transferred to other host machines, and backed up with snapshots.</p>
<p>Containers are an application of <strong>operating system virtualization</strong>. Containers act like virtual machines, but they share the host&#x2019;s kernel. Sharing a kernel is more efficient (no overhead is incurred from running another operating system), but less flexible (the guest operating system has to match the host).</p>
